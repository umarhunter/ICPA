    <h1>It all started in college</h1>
    <h2>Learning computer science principles in college is a great tool for being able to improve your programming abilities. However, a group of college students began to wonder, how can a programmer get better outside of school?</h2>
    <h2>Easy enough answer, right? Keep writing code! You will definitely improve your skills that way. </h2>
    <h2>The members of this group agreed, but there was something more important to them than just improving their programming skills alone. </h2>
    <h2>They wanted to learn and create together as a group and see what they can do. One programmer is capable of many tasks, a group, much more.</h2>
    <h2>This is how the idea of ICPA was formed.</h2>
